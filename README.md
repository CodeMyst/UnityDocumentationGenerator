# UnityDocumentationGenerator
Generates the Unity's documentation (manual and scripting reference) into 2 json files for fast search.

It's used for the [Brackeys Bot](https://github.com/YilianSource/brackeys-bot).

Before running the app you have to get the offline Unity documentation and place `Manual` and `ScriptReference` folders into the Documentation folder (in the root). And be sure to remove the `docdata` folder from `Manual` and `ScriptReference` folders.
